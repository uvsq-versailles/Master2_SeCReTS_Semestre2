This is a plaintext!

This example shows exactly why it is a very bad idea to use the same
modulus in two different keys.

If you broadcast a message with two different public exponents, then
an attacker can recover the plaintext in no time.

On the bright side, you got the flag: vfrbthvvrivnhgczctdcscdfv

By the way, you see how long a RSA 4096 message can be...
Since RSA is mostly used to encrypt a 128 to 256 bit AES key, there is
clearly a huge waste of space!
In this sense, ECC schemes are better!
