THE STORY
========

In the ennemy base, there is a building, which is guarded by hundreds of 
highly trained soldiers.

In this building, there is a WPA-PSK protected wifi with an unbreakable
password, like a 10 letter english word (all uppercase) followed by 2
digits.

In this wifi network, there is a web server that only the flag keeper
(=admin)  may access.

The flag is his password

Good luck!

PS: By the way, a geek visitor just told me he was walking around 
the base with his linux laptop (of course, his wlan interface was 
in  monitor-mode by default). Anyways, he gave me this capture:
psk-01.cap
