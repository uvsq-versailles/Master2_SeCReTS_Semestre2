The red flag keeper had a trouble because his flag was too easy to catch
by the blue team leader.

After a few mails with the customer service of the flag factory, he seems
happy with his new flag: the red-flag.gif file.

Only problem: it seems that someone (a.k.a YOU) was eavesdropping the last
conversation...

The flag you seek is the concatenation of the (lowercase hex) sha1sum of
the red-flag.gif file, and the smtp password of the flagkeeper. 

Good luck!
